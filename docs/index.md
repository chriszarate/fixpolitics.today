# Fix Politics Today

Our politics are hopelessly broken and it's my fault. The good news: I have a
pretty good idea how to fix it, starting today. The bad news: I can only fix it
for *me*.

This is not a retreat from politics or from the issues I care about. Nor is it
about transforming how I feel through sheer force of will or blind optimism. On
the contrary, this is my plan to make a greater political impact and do my part
to let destructive forces wither away.

More importantly, it's a realization that the hopelessness I feel towards
politics has less to do with election results and more to do with irrational
decisions I make:

1. **I think my vote, my voice, and my actions don't matter.** Don't get me
   wrong: I vote regularly, I wear the sticker, and I give the usual sermon to
   anyone who says voting is a waste. Inside, however, the fire has been dying,
   because I hitched my convictions to the outcomes of elections. My votes are
   a shield against guilt, my voice is a whisper among like-minded friends, and
   my actions are few and far between.

   <span class="fix">**Fix:** Act in accordance with my principles, especially
   when technology or commerce hides the effect of my actions on other people.
   Volunteer. Use my voice to speak on behalf of others and issues I care about.
   Take pride in voting knowing that is backed by words and action.</span>

2. **I read political sites, scroll through social feeds, and watch political
   shows even though I know they will leave me feeling angry and helpless.**
   Some of them are addictive, manipulative machines run by crass, disingenuous
   people. Others are addictive, manipulative machines run by smart,
   well-meaning people. All of them are poison in the sheer quantity I consume
   them. As adults, we look around at each other for clues that what we are
   doing is self-destructive, but it seems everyone I know has some measure of
   this addiction.

   <span class="fix">**Fix:** Staying informed is important but should not come
   at the expense of emotional health or motivation. Consume half as much
   political media, and half again. Try to avoid bias, but remember the more
   important balance is found outside of politics: read more books, talk to more
   people, and do more in the community.</span>

3. **Whenever I have a political conversation, I play the role of a person I
   hate: the idiotic talking head on cable news.** The sad truth is that it's
   the only way I know how to talk about politicsâ€”and, most of the time, the
   same is true of the person I'm talking with. I don't ask questions. I don't
   listen. I get angry even when the other person agrees with me. I learn
   nothing.

   <span class="fix">**Fix:** Stop echoing the empty rhetoric of people who get
   paid to fill dead air. At the same time, don't waste opportunities to talk
   about important issues with family, friends, and interesting people I meet.
   Ask questions, listen, learn, and give the benefit of the doubt. Tell them
   how I feel without stating it as fact. Accept that, in real life,
   conversations about complicated topics usually don't end with agreement or
   certainty.</span>

These are obvious fixes but will be difficult to achieve. Fixing politics is
worth it and starts today.
