# Fix politics today

Our politics are broken—and it's my fault. I've come to understand that my
feelings of hopelessness and anger are caused by my own irrational decisions. If
I can fix that, I can fix politics.

This is not a retreat from the issues I care about. This is my plan to make a
greater political impact and remove destructive forces from my life by
addressing these irrational decisions:

<div class="problem header-box">
  <h3>I act like my vote, my voice, and my actions don’t matter.</h3>
  <p>Don’t get me wrong: I vote regularly, I wear the sticker, and I give the
  usual sermon to anyone who says voting is a waste. Inside, however, the fire
  has been dying, because I hitched my convictions to the outcomes of elections.
  My votes are a shield against fear and guilt, my voice is a whisper among
  like-minded friends, and my actions are few and far between.</p>
</div>

<div class="fix header-box">
  <h3>Fix</h3>
  <p>Act in accordance with my principles, especially when technology and
  commerce hide the effect of my actions on other people. Volunteer. Use my
  voice to speak on behalf of others and issues I care about. Take pride in
  my vote knowing that is backed by words and action.</p>
</div>

<div class="problem header-box">
  <h3>I read political sites, scroll through social feeds, and watch political
  shows even though I know they will leave me feeling angry and helpless.</h3>
  <p>Some of them are addictive, manipulative machines run by crass,
  disingenuous people. Others are addictive, manipulative machines run by smart,
  well-meaning people. All of them are poison in the sheer quantity I consume
  them. As adults, we look around at each other for clues that what we are doing
  is self-destructive, but it seems everyone I know has some measure of this
  addiction.</p>
</div>

<div class="fix header-box">
  <h3>Fix</h3>
  <p>Staying informed is important but should not come at the expense of
  emotional health or motivation. Consume half as much political media, and half
  again. Try to avoid bias, but remember the more important balance is found
  outside of politics: read more books, talk to more people, and do more in the
  community.</p>
</div>

<div class="problem header-box">
  <h3>Whenever I have a political conversation, I play the role of a person I
  hate: the idiotic talking head on cable news.</h3>
  <p>The sad truth is that it’s the only way I know how to talk about
  politics—and, most of the time, the same is true of the person I’m talking
  with. I don’t ask questions. I don’t listen. I get angry even when the other
  person agrees with me. I learn nothing.</p>
</div>

<div class="fix header-box">
  <h3>Fix</h3>
  <p>Stop echoing the empty rhetoric of people who get paid to fill dead air. At
  the same time, don’t waste opportunities to talk about important issues with
  family, friends, and interesting people I meet. Ask questions, listen, learn,
  and give the benefit of the doubt. Tell them how I feel without stating it as
  fact. Accept that, in real life, conversations about complicated topics
  usually don’t end with agreement or certainty.</p>
</div>

<div class="problem header-box">
  <h3>I want to be distracted from the issues that matter most.</h3>
  <p>The news cycle is dizzying. I am barely done expressing outrage at one
  thing before I am handed something else to be outraged at. The truth is that I
  now expect—need—a steady stream of things to be outraged about. If I am not
  handed it, I seek it out. I no longer remember what resolution of an issue
  feels like. Instead, I see only a long trail of receding disappointments of
  my own creation.</p>
</div>

<div class="fix header-box">
  <h3>Fix</h3>
  <p>Don't look to the media to tell me what to be outraged about—or when it's
  time to move on. Maintain focus and action on issues that are important to me,
  even when they seem to fade from discussion. Contact representatives—local,
  state, and national—and ask what I can do to further the cause—especially
  if my representative disagrees with me. Ignore requests to take on more
  outrage before I'm ready for it.</p>
</div>

These are simple solutions to very hard problems. I know that some of these
irrational decisions are hard-wired into my very nature, but I will return to
this page often to remind myself how important it is to address them.
